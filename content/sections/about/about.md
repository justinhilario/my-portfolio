I have a background in biology and art and started my career as a Freelance Photographer/Videographer in San Diego, California. After a few years in the industry, I decided to blend my experiences in making art with my enthusiasm for science and technology, and enroll in a Full Stack development course at LEARN Academy. It has been a rewarding process to push my knowledge in both these disciplines further and to learn the fundamentals to creating captivating web applications.
