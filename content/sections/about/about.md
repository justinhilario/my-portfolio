After attending the University of California, San Diego to pursue medicine, I began my post-college career as a Freelance Photographer/Videographer in San Diego, California. After a few years in the industry, I decided to blend my experiences in making art with my enthusiasm for science and technology, and enroll in a Full Stack development course at LEARN Academy. It has been a rewarding process to push my knowledge in both these disciplines further and to learn the fundamentals to creating captivating web applications.
