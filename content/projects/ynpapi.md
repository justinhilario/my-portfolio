* Backend API built with Ruby on Rails and Full CRUD functionality. Allows the user to track wildlife sightings in Yosemite NP. Built with a focus on Test-Driven Development and includes RSpec tests for each RESTful route.
* The image was taken by myself during a snowstorm in Yosemite Valley. View more of my photography on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jvstnh/).
