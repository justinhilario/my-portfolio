* Backend API built with Ruby on Rails and Full CRUD functionality. Allows the user to track sightings of common wildlife in Yosemite National Park. Made with a focus on Test-Driven Development and includes tests for each RESTful route written with RSPEC. 
* The image was taken by myself during a snowstorm in Yosemite Valley.
